# Akatsuki-Website
A Project I did for a college Hackathon. This is a website that is inspired from a fictional group called Akatsuki. I created this website in 12 hours.
This project is basically a website for a fictional villian group which I did for fun at a hackathon. I had only 12 hours to do it. I did not make any changes after winning that hackathon. If Akatsuki had a real webiste for themselves this is how it would look like.
